# VArduino2
### A project by defvs

Welcome to the world of DIY paragliding :)
I know there is already a lot of arduino variometers projects out there, but I wanted to make a mix, while combining precision, easy info reading and compact build.

The code & the PCB layouts are available under GPL3. I'm interested in you forks dudes !

## Building the code
Tested building with latest ArduinoIDE. Doesn't go past the 30KB limit of the arduino.

## Creating the variometer
I've compiled some instructions on how to build the PCB for the arduino, in two version : an easy to solder one, but less compact, and a very small, SMD soldered, variometer. Be sure to check it out.
Send ~nudes~ circuit pictures of your builds, I'm interested in them !
